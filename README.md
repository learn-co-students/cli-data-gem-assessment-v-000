# TopGames


Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/top_games`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'top_games'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install top_games

## Usage

    Run the app by calling ./bin/top_games, after boot, it will pull up the top three games
    from pcgamer.com, after you can inquire a summary of each game by inputting the correct
    number, it will also bring you back to the main menu afterwards. You can type 'exit' to 
    quit the app. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
