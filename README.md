# Dog

Welcome to my first project! This is the Dog CLI Biography menu. What this command line interface does is that it has the user select one from many dogs and then scrapes data from the Purina website and gives a biography about that one dog the user chose. It gives the user many options on what dogs they would like to know more about.

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'dog'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dog

## Usage

This gem is used for people that would like to know more about certain dog breeds.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
