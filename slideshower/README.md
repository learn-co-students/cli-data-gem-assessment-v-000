# Slideshower

Welcome to Slideshower! This gem will ask you for a subject of stock photos you want to view, grabbing photos off of http:/www.pexels.com.

After typing the subject of stock photos you want to see, press enter, and a menu will appear. Pressing 1 will display the photos title and url one by one as a slideshow. Pressing 2 will allow you to view all of the photos at once. Pressing 3 will allow you to select a new subject of stock photos. Pressing 4 will exit the program.
