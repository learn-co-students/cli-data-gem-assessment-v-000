Wiki Tech Topics

This gem presents articles from the Computers and Technology section of www.wikihow.com in list form in a cli. The user will be presented with a numbered list of article titles to choose from and be able to access the article's content through typing in the number of the item. Future iterations of this gem may encompass articles collected from a greater number of tech-related sites and be searchable based on specific topic keywords.
