# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application: 'Irecycle' has a CLI.
- [x] Pull data from an external source: I'm pulling data from the website called Earth 911 (can be found at https://search.earth911.com).
- [x] Implement both list and detail views: 'Irecycle' provides the user a list of centers (names) and then it supplies the user the option to get more details (address, phone etc) of any of the centers.
