# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application - the cli file in this repository asks the user what they would like to do next and provides responses accordingly.
- [x] Pull data from an external source - category and book information are scraped from the "https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-books-2017" website
- [x] Implement both list and detail views - the user can get a list of categories and a list of books by category and then pick a book and get more details on that book.
