User will be able to choose from numbered list of article titles to see content

4.  Build out Scraper to scrape this page for attributes IN PROCESS
5.  Build out module DONE
6.  Make sure CLI works IN PROCESS
7.  Finish/proof Readme

Refactoring:

#pull titles from hash directly rather than from an array of hash/es
#use input methods with now-playing to make sure input is an integer
#consdier using @@all ||= scraped info like now playing
