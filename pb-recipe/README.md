# Recipe

Welcome to the Recipe of the Day Ruby gem! This gem includes a CLI that allows the user to view a dish of the day from two different websites. The websites include foodnetwork.com and mydailymoment.com. The user can choose which dish they would like more information on, including total time, servings, ingredients, and instructions.

## Installation

Install it yourself as:

    $ gem install recipe_of_the_day

## Usage
1. Run "ruby bin/recipe_of_the_day
2. Enter 1, 2, list, or end
3. Repeat step 2 until user enters "end"

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
