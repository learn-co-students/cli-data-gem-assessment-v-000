Wikihow Tech Topics

This gem presents the current articles from the Selecting and Buying a Computer page of the Computers and Technology section of www.wikihow.com in list form in a command line interface (CLI). 

## Instructions

The user will be presented with a numbered list of article titles to choose from and be able to access the article's basic steps, some in clearly numbered, multiple methods or parts, through typing in the number of the relevant number. The file, Scraper, which is responsible for doing the scraping of information from pages of www.wikihow.com, allows object methods for easy substitution/addition of specific pages at www.wikihow.co to scrape and include in the gem program. Furthermore, future versions of this gem may encompass articles collected from a greater number of tech-related sites and be searchable based on specific topic keywords.

NOTE: Content for this project was scraped directly from the website at https://www.wikihow.com/Category:Computers-and-Electronics. The project complies with Wikihow's Terms of Use, which can be accessed at https://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Terms-of-Use.
