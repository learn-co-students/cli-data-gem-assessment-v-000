# SimpleCollection

This program scrapes data from the website for the knitting pattern collection called "The Simple Collection" by Tin Can Knits.
The program will generate a list of patterns and the user will select which pattern they would like to have more information about.
The program will then generate information about the pattern, such as sizing, materials, gauge, suggested needles, notes, and a description. 


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'simple_collection'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install simple_collection
