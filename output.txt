She is anxious , eating very little and obviously does not understand what is going on or where her family is. Don't try to tell this senior to slow down; Kenya is quite athletic and runs and plays just fine, thank you very much!  Kenya loves to go for car rides and long walks with her foster family, as well as snuggling up for head rubs.  She has settled into her foster home nicely, also enjoying naps on her dog bed, hanging out with her foster siblings, and taking her chew bones wherever she goes.  This affectionate lady walks well on leash and knows her basic commands.  If you would like to meet Kenya, please contact our Adoptions Coordinator for more information.", @id="1186", @image_url="https://magsr.org/sites/default/files/kenya_12_14_17_profile.png">, #<Dog:0x000000020f7150

should he have it he will be started on enzymes, it's that simple.  He is such a friendly boy who thinks he is a lap dog.  He is good with other dogs.  Watch for updates.", @id="2462",

manners, good leash skills and of course help him bond with his new family. ", @id="2525", @image_url="https://magsr.org/sites/default/files/buck_20171217-1.jpg">, #<Dog:0x000000020f67a0 @name="Kovu",

the way of training and knew that he needed an experienced family to help him adjust to a new life.  Kovu has not been well socialized or provided with proper training.  He can be protective of his person if he feels you are not in control.  He will bark at people he doesn't know, but takes correction and redirection well.  He needs slower introductions to new people, dogs and situations in order for him to feel comfortable.  Training is an absolute must for Kovu and his new family as this will help everyone learn more about Kovu and get him on the right track.  Kovu will only meet those with a lot of experience with the breed and are strong, knowledgeable handlers.  Kovu needs someone who is going to commit to him, provide him with direction and consistency in his life.  Our

Let me explain my situation and get you up to speed. I managed to get myself in quite a pickle as I landed myself in local  shelter as a stray. I am not really sure what a stray is but I will figure that out later.  The accommodations were not bad. They were really nice to me and I did get a warm bed and two squares a day! It was kind of rough though because I was use to em... certain luxeries. I was at this place for about a month when they told me my foster family was coming to pick me up and bring me home! They are amazing and I am really living it up here wth them but foster mean temporary until my perfect home presents itself. They told me I can stay as long as I need to which makes me so happy. I even heard them say they were taking me to acupuncture this weekend so I am hoping that is some sort of massage and they provide treats! I will update later on how that goes.. So dont worry, I am in a good place as I interviewSo back to my requirements.. you know a senior  gentleman has certain needs and things we become accustomed to. I like a soft orthopedic bed with a blanky, I demand regular head and belly scratches, and daily treats. And let's be clear, I DONT enjoy steps and can only get up or down one or two steps because I sustained a bad pelvic injury in my younger days that never healed correctly so I only get around on three legs. My back leg is pretty useless although it does help to steady me when begging at the table... I have learned to compensate for my injury and do still enjoy playing and romping in the yard. My new family will need to provide some pain meds and supplements to help keep me as pain free as possible. Here is a positive.. I am totally house broken but do require to be let out every few hours as in my old age I just can't hold it as long as when I was a young buck.. My favorite past time aside from eating is sleeping because don't forget I am a senior boy and require several naps.. I am the most laid back guy that you will ever meet! I like my doggie friends big and small! I am just an all around great companion and just want a person to call my own. I will follow you around and lay at your feet! If you feel you could be my forever family and provide for my senior needs please apply above! Love Sarge", @id="2157", @image_url="https://magsr.org/sites/default/files/sarge_20170929-2_0.jpg">]
